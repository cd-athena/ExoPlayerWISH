# WISH: User-centric Bitrate Adaptation for HTTP Adaptive Streaming on Mobile Devices #

We implemented our recent proposed ABR algorithm based on a **W**e**I**ghted **S**um model for **H**AS, namely WISH, in [ExoPlayer][].
WISH takes into account three cost factors of each video representation: (a) *throughput cost*, (b) *buffer cost*, and (c) *quality cost*.
An overall cost, which is a weighted sum of these penalties, represents each video representation. Our proposed method provides the optimal segment bitrate by choosing the representation with the lowest overall cost for a certain time. A solution determining the weights of the cost factors based on end usersâ€™ preferences and mobile devices will be introduced in this work.
